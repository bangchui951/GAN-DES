# GAN-DES
#Introduction
GAN-DES is a hardware security detection framework that combines Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with deep learning-based detectors to identify evasive Spectre attacks. This project leverages a generator to simulate attack samples and trains a detector to distinguish between real and adversarial behaviors.
